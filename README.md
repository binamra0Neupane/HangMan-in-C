This was my final project for CSE 1310 "INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS & PROGRAMMING". Written in C, it is a text-based Hangman game that lets the user guess a randomly generated word.

The program reads a list of words from a text file, selects one at random, and challenges the player to guess the word one letter at a time within a limited number of tries. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, displays the current progress with hidden letters represented as asterisks, and visually represents the hangman figure as chances decrease.

Key features include:

- Random word selection from an external file

- Case-sensitive character input validation

- Dynamic display of guessed letters and remaining attempts

- A simple ASCII art hangman that builds as the user makes wrong guesses

- Replay option to start a new game without restarting the program

This project helped me practice file handling, string manipulation, conditional logic, loops, and dynamic memory management in C.
